# Example 02: Scanning For an iMS System

In example 1, we set up a simple CMake project that linked to the iMS control library and saw how CMake could be used to build iMS applications with just a few lines of C++ code.

Let's build on this example to search for and connect to some iMS hardware.

You will, of course, need some Isomet iMS hardware.  In this example, we will assume you have an iMS4-P rev C on hand and connected through Ethernet.  There are other models available within the range but these basic steps are always the same.
